# MicroMadeEasy

MicroMadeEasy is built on matic net with torus login. Users can transfer cryptos without paying the gas fee. Only a
single transaction by sender is required to send transactions. Any number of transactions can be sent without worrying about the gas fee.
The withdraw transaction will be executed on the blockchain. It uses `transferFrom` function of erc20 contracts. 

Users are NOT expected to open a seperate channel for every new merchant they are interacting.
